## Tools

### Overlay

The overlay will render an image above the canvas showing incorrect pixels, if you would like to help out this is your best bet!
The overlay itself and instructions to install it can be found in the [/overlay](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/tree/main/overlay) directory

### Tux Coords

If you do not wish to install the overlay you can find an image with coords attached [here](https://r-placetux.github.io/place_tux/tux_coords.png).

## The Git Repo for [r/placetux](https://reddit.com/r/placetux) on [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place)

We aim to plan out and draw Tux and a few Distro/DE logos in the Reddit r/place event.

### Canvas Size?

Ideally we would take up the entire 2000x1000 canvas for ourselves, but that would make other communities sad... And it's also impossible. We would create 3 progressively larger pixel arts (a 50x50, a 75x75 and a 100x100 version) for Tux and Distro/DE. We would draw the appropriate one in r/place, based on territory gained.

## Why should I use Linux?

#### It respects your freedom and privacy.

- You can see every line of code it uses, so you can be sure there is no backdoor or keylogger. (The NSA tried 3 times to get a backdoor into linux, but failed)

#### It runs on older computers, saving them from the landfill.

- It is very fast and lightweight.

- It costs exactly 0$

#### It's yours.

- **_EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF LINUX_** can be modified to however you want, and is only limited by hardware.

- It can look real sexy (take a look at [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn/)).

- You don't have a giant, monoply, money-seeking company forcing you to do what it tells you to do, making you the product (I'm looking at you Microsoft and Apple...)

- Many, many options to choose from, to customize it.

- You get to brag about how smart you are when a Windoze user sees you "hAcKIng" (I use arch btw).

#### It's Powerful and secure.

- The command line is really good and lets you do very big things in one line, while user-friendly interfaces work well for those that don't want to use commands.

- Package managers make installing software a breeze.

- It's almost impossible to get a virus on it, and there are still antiviruses for it.

- **_TONS_** of support for Linux, ask a question, and in a few minutes people will be responding.

- Countless other reasons.
